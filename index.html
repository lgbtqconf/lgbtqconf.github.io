            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">LGBTQ+ communities around the world are facing challenges to achieving and sustaining progress. Today's political and social climate makes it increasingly important to uplift and center LGBTQ+ people. As a community, this requires us to empower historically oppressed and excluded voices, and consider new dialogues and actions in solidarity.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Genuine partnership with one another must transcend borders—including but not limited to ability, age, class, education, ethnicity, gender, geography, language, nationality, race, religion, and sexuality—as we work together toward meaningful change. Our conference aims to create an intersectional space in which to build such coalitions, toward the goals of resistance, transformation, and healing.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Through the theme Partners in Justice and Equity, this conference will explore how LGBTQ+ people—activists and advocates, inside and outside of social and political institutions—are working to bring explicitly queer values of love, courage, and liberation to the places where they are needed most. Our goal is to think, plan, and implement in the direction of a better future, not just for LGBTQ+ people, but for all.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s"><strong>The Harvard LGBTQ Conference is open to all and is not restricted to Harvard affiliates or people who identify as members of the LGBTQ community. We look forward to welcoming you!</strong></h3>

              <h3>Dr. Robyn Henderson-Espinoza</h3>
              <h2>Christian theologian</h2>
              <p>Knowing intimately that the borderlands are a place of learning and growth, Robyn draws on their identity and heritage as a Transqueer Latinx in everything that they do.  From doubt to divine and everywhere in between, their call as an activist-theologian demands the vision to disrupt hegemony and colonialist structures of multi-layered oppressions.  As an anti-oppression, anti-racist, non-binary Trans*gressive Latinx, Robyn takes seriously their call as an activist theologian and ethicist to bridge together theories and practices that result in communities responding to pressing social concerns.  Robyn sees this work as a life-orienting vocation, deeply committed to translating theory to practice, and embedded in re-imagining our moral horizon to one which privileges a politics of radical difference. Robyn has a PhD in Constructive Philosophical Theology & Ethics from The University of Denver.</p>
